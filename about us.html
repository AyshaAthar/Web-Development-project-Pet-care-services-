  <h3><b>About us</b></h3>
  </section>
  <div class="background"><h4>Paws and Claws began as a family run pet sitting business in 2005, established to offer an innovative alternative to dog kennels and cattery,<br> or having to rely on neighbours or family for holiday pet care.</h4>
  <p>A bespoke service was created which allowed pet owners to go away on holiday or out to work, and relax, knowing their home is safe and their pet cared for in accordance with their exact wishes.
      Due to the overwhelming success of the first Paw Pals branch the opportunity to franchise the business nationally was created and services such as clinical, grooming, and shopping were included.

      <br><br>With branches across India, Paws and Claws is now run by Managing Director Neha Bhatia, who originally started out a Paw Pal herself. She managed her successful Delhi branch for 4 years before selling on to the current owner.

      <br><br>Only the most genuine, caring and professional people join the Paw Pals team and our franchise recruitment process is extremely thorough.
      All of our dog walkers and pet sitters are police checked, fully insured and are pet first aid trained. Our Paw Pals are also registered with the Pet Industry Federation, a trade association promoting excellence across the pet care industry in India.
      Our doctors and staff at pet clinics are friendly and genuinely concerned about your pet's welfare. We take pride in the professional capabilities of each member of our staff. They are carefully chosen not only for their abilities, but also for their love and desire to help both pets and people.
